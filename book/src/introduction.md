Bradipograph is an open-source build-it-yourself robot for drawing on windows
and blackboards. Controlled over bluetooth, it can draw svgs and comes with a
library of tools for procedurally generating line drawings.

This book contains instructions to build and run your own bradipograph. Assembly
requires a 3d printer, a soldering iron, and about $20 worth of parts.
