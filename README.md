# Bradipograph

A drawing robot that's kind of like a [sloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-toed_sloth),
because it hangs from its arms and moves slowly.

This repository contains source code and CAD files for 3d printing. If you want to actually build
one, see the [bradipograph book](https://jneem.github.io/bradipograph).
